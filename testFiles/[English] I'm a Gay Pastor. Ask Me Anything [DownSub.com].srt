1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
- [Interviewer] If you
were alone in a room

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,440
with a gay pastor, what would you ask?

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,140
- Do you view yourself
as an openly gay pastor

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,520
as a political statement?

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,070
- What are your thoughts
on conversion therapy?

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,310
- Does it really say in the
Bible that being gay is a sin?

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,876
- So the first thing is we
have to look at is that...

8
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:19,890
(upbeat drumming)

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,640
- Hi, I'm Hadidas, and I have
some questions for you today.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,170
- Awesome. Nice to meet you, Hadidas.

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,610
My name is Pastor Curt.

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,800
- My first question is,
what is your religion?

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,740
- I am a progressive Pentecostal,

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,090
which would be a Christian.

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,100
- What inspired you to become a Pastor?

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,210
- It's a funny story. I really
didn't desire to be a pastor.

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,800
I wanted to be a police officer.

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,020
And so I always joke when I'm preaching

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,640
that I got the peas mixed up.

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,400
There was a church looking
for a youth leader,

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,140
so I took the youth leader job,

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,150
developed a passion and a love for it.

23
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,583
- Is being gay ever an issue for you?

24
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,180
Like, does that affect you
being a pastor in any way?

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,950
- In some instances it does.

26
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,860
I get uninvited to stuff
and I'm the black sheep

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,900
of some of some spaces.

28
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,060
You know, something happened
that was really funny.

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,980
One of my friends invited me to come

30
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,330
and preach at his church.

31
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,120
Some of the members from that congregation

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,150
wanted to hear me again,
so they came to my church.

33
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,730
I wanted to thank God for
my boyfriend being there,

34
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,730
and I saw every person that
came from that congregation,

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,980
they got up and exited, stage right.

36
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,940
- Oh, wow.

37
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,650
- I get a lot of hate mail,

38
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,260
that I'm going to hell and
I'm teaching false doctrine.

39
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,720
In the beginning of my
ministry, that hurt me.

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,350
On the flip side, when a
young person comes to you

41
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,630
and they're thinking
about committing suicide,

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,647
then who's gonna hold
them up and tell them,

43
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:43,357
"You know what, you don't have to give up

44
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:46,387
"and you don't have to allow
people to dictate your path.

45
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:48,870
"You have the power to
dictate your own path."

46
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,550
- I definitely resonate with that a lot.

47
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,220
- Have you ever had to hide yourself

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,170
to the people of your church?

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,300
- I don't think that I hid my sexuality

50
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,050
or hid who I am but I did
use a lot of discretion

51
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,550
so that I wouldn't offend people.

52
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,990
It took me until 26 to actually,
authentically, be myself.

53
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,979
I went through this journey of
dating girls and dating guys.

54
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,360
I would go out with my girlfriend

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,017
because I wanted everybody
in the church to love me

56
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:17,670
and to like me and then I would go home

57
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,770
and cuddle with my boyfriend after.

58
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,290
It wasn't until like I
had an "ahoo" moment,

59
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,660
I just said basically to hell with people

60
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,760
and I understand that God created me

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,700
and he built me to be
the person that I am.

62
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,830
And nobody can be Curt but Curt.

63
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,840
- I mean, I'm also gay.

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,897
- Yay.

65
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:36,420
(Curt clapping)
- Yay! (giggling)

66
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,420
And it definitely took me a bit longer

67
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,130
than I would've liked
to have figured it out.

68
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,340
- How did the acceptance in the church

69
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,340
of queer people affect you
and your own mental state?

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,980
- I don't think my
sexuality was exposed yet.

71
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,800
But I will tell you
that I use hand gestures

72
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,507
and the bishop called me into
his office and he was like,

73
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:00,817
"All those, those hand
gestures and stuff like that

74
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:02,790
"that you're doing, men, don't do that."

75
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,120
It triggered me to where
if I move my hands,

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,030
I'll catch myself, put my hands together

77
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,650
and say, no, don't move your hands.

78
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,900
- I remember I had a similar experience,

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,850
not so much hand movements,
but the way I walked.

80
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,220
Like, I remember it was
like three of the older guys

81
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,577
were like, "You know,
you walk like a girl.

82
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:20,022
"Why is your butt out like that?"

83
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:20,855
(Curt chuckling)

84
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:24,330
And I didn't think I was
walking like so flamboyantly

85
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,000
but that moment stuck with me up until now

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,900
I still think about it.

87
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,020
- I think that in the
world that we live in today

88
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,118
that we can actually be more gender fluid.

89
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:34,951
- Mhm.

90
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:36,720
- And if you like it, you
like it, make it work.

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,010
So that's how the world needs to be.

92
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,060
Make it work.

93
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,050
- Yeah.

94
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,740
- How does your family
handle your sexuality

95
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,510
and your religious together?

96
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,030
- My family is very understanding.

97
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,180
In all actuality, my parents
are members of my church.

98
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,850
I don't really have a coming out story

99
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,710
because I really never came out,

100
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,620
I just became more authentically myself.

101
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,890
But I will say I had
an initial conversation

102
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,970
with my parents.

103
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,340
My mom said that she already knew.

104
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,650
It took my dad two years,

105
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,740
he would use terms like
'them' and 'those people.'

106
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,410
Now he understands that
at the end of the day

107
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,700
that it's all about love.

108
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,709
- Have you ever taken
and 'Am I gay?' quiz?

109
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,239
- No, I've never done that.

110
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,072
- I've taken them.

111
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,342
- Okay.
- That's why I asked.

112
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,959
- What was your results?

113
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,220
- Bisexual, baby.

114
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,660
- All right.
(laughing)

115
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,330
- Do you view yourself
as an openly gay pastor

116
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,800
as a political statement?

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,940
- Mm, no.

118
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,830
Me being a pastor just means

119
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,020
that I'm passionate about people,

120
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,370
and that God has called me and
giving me a unique identifier

121
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,680
to be able to love and to appreciate

122
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,243
and to speak life into people.

123
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:46,020
- Does it really say in the
Bible that being gay is a sin?

124
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,370
- Biblical text doesn't
introduce the word homosexuality

125
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,930
until the 1900s.

126
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,280
And so then you have to go back

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,220
and you have to look at
the original manuscript,

128
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,920
which frames it from a
different perspective.

129
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,700
So it talks about giving
the natural affection

130
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,790
of a man to a woman or a woman to a man.

131
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,680
Well, what is your natural affection?

132
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,630
Is your natural affection to a man

133
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,310
or is your natural affection to a woman?

134
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,760
We are divinely everything
that God wants us to be.

135
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,690
- I think that's awesome.

136
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,640
I've never heard that part of it before.

137
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,460
- What are your thoughts
on conversion therapy?

138
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,110
- Oh, I think there's the stupidest thing

139
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,760
that somebody could ever do

140
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,560
and I hope that whoever does that,

141
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,630
I hope that they find a guiding light.

142
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,470
People can't be converted from
who they authentically are.

143
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,420
There's something that was called Exodus.

144
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,530
They would learn the Bible

145
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,760
and they would stay there and pray,

146
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,550
and think that that would
change their situation.

147
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,870
But they found out that

148
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,810
they were sneaking in each
other's rooms late at night,

149
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,373
so it didn't work. (chuckling)

150
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,310
- Do you believe that you will go to hell?

151
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,330
- Oh, hecky by jecky, no.
I'm not going to hell.

152
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,920
I think that God is very heart intended,

153
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,390
and so he looks at our heart.

154
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,300
I don't think in him, there's
neither male nor female.

155
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,360
- I definitely think that
God looks at your soul

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,850
and not at who you choose to love.

157
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,810
- How does it make you feel
when more conservative pastors

158
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,570
spread hate about the LGBTQ community,

159
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,490
and even like spread like threats?

160
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,240
- It hurts my feelings
that people operate in hate

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,810
especially when we serve a God that loves.

162
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,350
John 3:16 says, "For
God so loved the world."

163
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,570
When people teach hate instead of love

164
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,510
it makes me one, question their ability

165
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,270
to really hear from God
or to speak for God.

166
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,610
- Was there ever a time that
you resented the church?

167
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,050
- Yes, I had a situation where I was fired

168
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,440
and I resented the church
for a very long time.

169
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,130
My therapist was able
to help me understand

170
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,870
how to feel better about myself.

171
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,960
- So how does one take religion

172
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,570
and come to terms with themselves?

173
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,640
Like, this is that love
you're talking about.

174
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,920
How do we find our own truth?

175
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,510
- The first misconception

176
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,330
is that people want to be religious.

177
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,420
God's desire is to be relational with us.

178
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,030
If we go back to Genesis
and we look in the garden

179
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,360
with Adam and Eve, God was
building relationship with them,

180
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,430
he wasn't building religion with them.

181
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,490
- Do you ever get any
judgment from queer people

182
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,620
about you being so religious?

183
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,170
- So many gay people have been hurt

184
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,270
or damaged by the church.

185
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,790
You know, it does take people a minute

186
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,720
to realize that religion
is not what we do,

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,640
relationship is what we build.

188
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,280
- What advice would you
give to a gay person

189
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,130
who is fearful of going to church?

190
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,500
- You can Google and find churches

191
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,360
that are inclusive and accepting,

192
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,390
and then after you do that
you have to find a church

193
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,760
that meets your specific needs.

194
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,930
I think one of the downfalls
with going to just any church

195
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,570
is that some churches are tolerant

196
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,040
but they're not celebratory.

197
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,810
A church that tolerates people

198
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,850
is a church where you won't see anybody

199
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,190
that looks like you in the leadership.

200
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,460
I started my church 12 years ago

201
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,600
because I wanted to
make sure that there was

202
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,080
a place where people could
feel comfortable and safe.

203
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,330
My church is not just a gay church.

204
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,550
So you have straight
people, you have gay people,

205
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,530
you have upside down people, you know,

206
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,750
we're like Dr. Seuss, you know,

207
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,700
it's a table full of everybody.

208
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,200
- So would you say your church is like

209
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,270
more of the eccentric, loud,

210
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,190
or is it more on like quiet side?

211
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,909
- My church is... loud.

212
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,989
Jump, scream, holler, enjoy
yourself while you're there.

213
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,270
Renewed, which is the name of my church.

214
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,260
You can experience renewal
in whatever process or way

215
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,060
that you need to experience it.

216
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,240
We have this time in the service
where we do meet and greet

217
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,510
and a girl came up to me after,
at the end of the service

218
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,140
and said that she hadn't been
hugged by anyone in two years.

219
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,570
- Just knowing that someone like you

220
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,530
as an openly queer pastor is
just out there in the world

221
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,720
and just like a young little gay boy

222
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,370
is able to look at you and be like, wow,

223
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,980
is very special to me and I
want thank you personally.

224
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,940
- Ah, thank you.

225
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,110
So you say, I'm out here
and I'm out here to stay.

226
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,230
- [Interviewer] Would you
guys like to meet each other?

227
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,112
- Yes.
- I would love to.

228
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:16,680
- Ah, I knew it was you.
- It's me!

229
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,150
- You are a fireball.

230
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,473
I knew you were short.

231
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,500
- Smash or pass, Jesus.

232
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,965
- Oh, I'm gonna pass on Jesus.

233
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:24,798
(laughing)

234
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,430
Oh, I don't even want to
think about it like that.

235
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,963
- My bad, my bad.
