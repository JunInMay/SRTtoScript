1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
- [Interviewer] If you\nwere alone in a room

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,439
with a gay pastor, what would you ask?

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,140
- Do you view yourself\nas an openly gay pastor

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,070
- What are your thoughts\non conversion therapy?

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,310
- Does it really say in the\nBible that being gay is a sin?

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,876
- So the first thing is we\nhave to look at is that...

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,640
- Hi, I'm Hadidas, and I have\nsome questions for you today.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,170
- Awesome. Nice to meet you, Hadidas.

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,800
- My first question is,\nwhat is your religion?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,740
- I am a progressive Pentecostal

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,100
- What inspired you to become a Pastor?

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,210
- It's a funny story. I really\ndidn't desire to be a pastor.

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,800
I wanted to be a police officer.

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,019
And so I always joke when I'm preaching

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,399
There was a church looking\nfor a youth leader

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,149
developed a passion and a love for it.

17
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,582
- Is being gay ever an issue for you?

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,179
Like, does that affect you\nbeing a pastor in any way?

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,859
I get uninvited to stuff\nand I'm the black sheep

20
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,060
You know, something happened\nthat was really funny.

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,980
One of my friends invited me to come

22
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,120
Some of the members from that congregation

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,150
wanted to hear me again,\nso they came to my church.

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,730
I wanted to thank God for\nmy boyfriend being there

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,730
and I saw every person that\ncame from that congregation

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,980
they got up and exited, stage right.

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,260
that I'm going to hell and\nI'm teaching false doctrine.

28
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,719
In the beginning of my\nministry, that hurt me.

29
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,349
On the flip side, when a\nyoung person comes to you

30
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,629
and they're thinking\nabout committing suicide

31
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,646
then who's gonna hold\nthem up and tell them

32
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:43,356
You know what, you don\'t have to give up

33
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:46,387
and you don\'t have to allow\npeople to dictate your path.

34
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:48,870
You have the power to\ndictate your own path.

35
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,550
- I definitely resonate with that a lot.

36
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,219
- Have you ever had to hide yourself

37
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,299
- I don't think that I hid my sexuality

38
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,049
or hid who I am but I did\nuse a lot of discretion

39
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,549
so that I wouldn't offend people.

40
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,989
It took me until 26 to actually,\nauthentically, be myself.

41
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,979
I went through this journey of\ndating girls and dating guys.

42
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,359
I would go out with my girlfriend

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,017
because I wanted everybody\nin the church to love me

44
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:17,669
and to like me and then I would go home

45
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,769
and cuddle with my boyfriend after.

46
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,290
It wasn\'t until like I\nhad an "ahoo" moment

47
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:24,659
I just said basically to hell with people

48
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,759
and I understand that God created me

49
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,699
and he built me to be\nthe person that I am.

50
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,829
And nobody can be Curt but Curt.

51
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:36,419
(Curt clapping)\n- Yay! (giggling)

52
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:39,419
And it definitely took me a bit longer

53
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:41,129
than I would've liked\nto have figured it out.

54
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:44,340
- How did the acceptance in the church

55
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,340
of queer people affect you\nand your own mental state?

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,979
- I don't think my\nsexuality was exposed yet.

57
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,799
But I will tell you\nthat I use hand gestures

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,507
and the bishop called me into\nhis office and he was like

59
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:00,817
All those, those hand\ngestures and stuff like that

60
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:02,790
that you\'re doing, men, don\'t do that.

61
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,120
It triggered me to where\nif I move my hands

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,030
I'll catch myself, put my hands together

63
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,650
and say, no, don't move your hands.

64
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,900
- I remember I had a similar experience

65
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,849
not so much hand movements,\nbut the way I walked.

66
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,219
Like, I remember it was\nlike three of the older guys

67
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:18,576
were like, "You know,\nyou walk like a girl.

68
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:20,021
Why is your butt out like that?

69
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:24,329
And I didn't think I was\nwalking like so flamboyantly

70
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,000
but that moment stuck with me up until now

71
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,020
- I think that in the\nworld that we live in today

72
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,118
that we can actually be more gender fluid.

73
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,719
- And if you like it, you\nlike it, make it work.

74
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,009
So that's how the world needs to be.

75
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,740
- How does your family\nhandle your sexuality

76
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:48,030
- My family is very understanding.

77
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,180
In all actuality, my parents\nare members of my church.

78
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,849
I don't really have a coming out story

79
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,710
because I really never came out

80
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,620
I just became more authentically myself.

81
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,890
But I will say I had\nan initial conversation

82
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,340
My mom said that she already knew.

83
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,740
he would use terms like\n'them' and 'those people.'

84
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,409
Now he understands that\nat the end of the day

85
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,709
- Have you ever taken\nand 'Am I gay?' quiz?

86
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,342
- Okay.\n- That's why I asked.

87
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,330
- Do you view yourself\nas an openly gay pastor

88
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:34,019
that I'm passionate about people

89
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,370
and that God has called me and\ngiving me a unique identifier

90
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,680
to be able to love and to appreciate

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,242
and to speak life into people.

92
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:46,019
- Does it really say in the\nBible that being gay is a sin?

93
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,370
- Biblical text doesn't\nintroduce the word homosexuality

94
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,280
And so then you have to go back

95
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,219
and you have to look at\nthe original manuscript

96
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,920
which frames it from a\ndifferent perspective.

97
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,699
So it talks about giving\nthe natural affection

98
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,789
of a man to a woman or a woman to a man.

99
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,680
Well, what is your natural affection?

100
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,629
Is your natural affection to a man

101
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:11,310
or is your natural affection to a woman?

102
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,759
We are divinely everything\nthat God wants us to be.

103
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,639
I've never heard that part of it before.

104
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,459
- What are your thoughts\non conversion therapy?

105
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,109
- Oh, I think there's the stupidest thing

106
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,560
and I hope that whoever does that

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,629
I hope that they find a guiding light.

108
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:31,469
People can't be converted from\nwho they authentically are.

109
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,420
There's something that was called Exodus.

110
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:35,759
and they would stay there and pray

111
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,550
and think that that would\nchange their situation.

112
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,810
they were sneaking in each\nother's rooms late at night

113
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,372
so it didn't work. (chuckling)

114
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:47,310
- Do you believe that you will go to hell?

115
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,329
- Oh, hecky by jecky, no.\nI'm not going to hell.

116
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,919
I think that God is very heart intended

117
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,300
I don't think in him, there's\nneither male nor female.

118
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,360
- I definitely think that\nGod looks at your soul

119
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,850
and not at who you choose to love.

120
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,810
- How does it make you feel\nwhen more conservative pastors

121
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,569
spread hate about the LGBTQ community

122
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,490
and even like spread like threats?

123
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,240
- It hurts my feelings\nthat people operate in hate

124
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,810
especially when we serve a God that loves.

125
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,350
John 3:16 says, "For\nGod so loved the world.

126
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,570
When people teach hate instead of love

127
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:30,509
it makes me one, question their ability

128
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,269
to really hear from God\nor to speak for God.

129
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,609
- Was there ever a time that\nyou resented the church?

130
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,050
- Yes, I had a situation where I was fired

131
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,439
and I resented the church\nfor a very long time.

132
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,129
My therapist was able\nto help me understand

133
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,870
how to feel better about myself.

134
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,959
- So how does one take religion

135
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,569
and come to terms with themselves?

136
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:56,639
Like, this is that love\nyou're talking about.

137
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,329
is that people want to be religious.

138
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,419
God's desire is to be relational with us.

139
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,030
If we go back to Genesis\nand we look in the garden

140
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,359
with Adam and Eve, God was\nbuilding relationship with them

141
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,430
he wasn't building religion with them.

142
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,490
- Do you ever get any\njudgment from queer people

143
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,170
- So many gay people have been hurt

144
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,789
You know, it does take people a minute

145
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,720
to realize that religion\nis not what we do

146
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,279
- What advice would you\ngive to a gay person

147
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,129
who is fearful of going to church?

148
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,500
- You can Google and find churches

149
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,360
that are inclusive and accepting

150
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,389
and then after you do that\nyou have to find a church

151
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,759
that meets your specific needs.

152
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,930
I think one of the downfalls\nwith going to just any church

153
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,569
is that some churches are tolerant

154
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,850
is a church where you won't see anybody

155
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,189
that looks like you in the leadership.

156
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:05,459
I started my church 12 years ago

157
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,599
because I wanted to\nmake sure that there was

158
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,080
a place where people could\nfeel comfortable and safe.

159
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,329
My church is not just a gay church.

160
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,550
So you have straight\npeople, you have gay people

161
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,530
you have upside down people, you know

162
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:21,750
we're like Dr. Seuss, you know

163
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,699
it's a table full of everybody.

164
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,199
- So would you say your church is like

165
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:29,189
or is it more on like quiet side?

166
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,990
Jump, scream, holler, enjoy\nyourself while you're there.

167
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,269
Renewed, which is the name of my church.

168
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,259
You can experience renewal\nin whatever process or way

169
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,239
We have this time in the service\nwhere we do meet and greet

170
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,509
and a girl came up to me after,\nat the end of the service

171
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:55,139
and said that she hadn't been\nhugged by anyone in two years.

172
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,569
